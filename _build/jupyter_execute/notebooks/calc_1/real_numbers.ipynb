    "The real numbers are the set of all positive and negative numbers, as well as 0. We denote it as $\\mathbb{R}$. One can [Construct the Reals](https://sites.math.washington.edu//~toro/Courses/09-10/524/construction-reals.pdf), but its a bit technical and a physics major will (probably) never need to see that so I won't go through that here. \n",

    "Things you can do with real numbers: Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide (except by 0), and compare (for 2 real numbers one must be greater than the other OR they are equal). All of the typical algebraic rules apply to real numbers.\n",

    "Things you can't do: Divide by 0, take square roots of negative numbers.\n",
