    "The next step from limits of functions is derivatives. Here I'll jump right into the formal definition:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Def.** Let $f: (a,b)\\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a function. We say $f$ is **differentiable at $x_0$** if the following limit exists:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f'(x_0) = \\lim_{x\\to x_0}\\frac{f(x_0)- f(x)}{x_0 - x}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We call $f'(x_0)$ the **derivative of $f$ at $x_0$**. If this limit exists for all $x_0 \\in (a,b)$, we say $f$ is **differentiable**. In that case, the function $f':(a,b) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is called the **derivative** of $f$ and is denoted: $f' = \\frac{d}{dx}(f) = \\frac{df}{dx}$. We also call $\\frac{d}{dx}$ a **differential operator**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that differentiablility is stronger than continuity. $f$ is differentiable $\\implies$ $f$ is continuous, but not the other way. $f$ being continuous does not imply that $f$ is differntiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you know, the derivative of a function tells you the slope of the original function. This has an immense amount of uses, as you are no doubt already aware. "
