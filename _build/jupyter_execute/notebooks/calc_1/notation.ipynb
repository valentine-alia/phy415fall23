    "- $\\in$ means \"belongs to the set\" or \"is in.\" $a \\in S$ means that $a$ is in the set $S$. \n",
    "- $\\forall$ means \"for all\" or \"for every.\" $\\forall x \\in S$ means for all $x$ in the set $S$.\n",
    "- $\\exists$ means \"there exists\" \n",
    "- $:=$ and $\\equiv$ and mean \"is defined as\" or \"is denoted.\" Ex. $\\vec{r}_{sep} \\equiv \\vec{r}_{obs} - \\vec{r}_{source}$ means \"The separation vector is defined as the observation position vector minus the source position vector.\" ($\\dot{=}$ is also used for defining sometimes, I'm looking at you McIntyre)\n",
    "- Sets are usually defined within curly brackets $\\{ \\} $. $:$ or $|$ within these brackets typically means \"satisfying\" or \"such that,\" (such that is sometimes abbreviated to s.t.)\n",
    " - $ E\\subset S $ means $E$ is a subset of $S$, every element of $E$ is also an element of $S$\n",
    " - $f:A\\to B$ denotes a function that maps from the set $A$ to the set $B$.\n",
    " - $\\setminus$ means \"takeaway.\" $A\\setminus \\{x\\}$ means $A$ takeaway x, and is the set $A$ with $x$ removed.\n",

    " - $\\mathbb{N}$ is the **Natural Numbers**. These are counting numbers $1, 2, 3, ...$. Occassionaly these are defined as starting at $0$ instead of $1$, but starting at $1$ is typical in the U.S.\n",
    " - $\\mathbb{Z}$ is the **Integers**. These are like the natural numbers, but they can also be negative: $... -3,-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3...$\n",
    " - $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the **Rational Numbers**. These are numbers that can be represented as a ratio of two integers: $\\mathbb{Q} := \\{\\frac{a}{b}: a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\text{ and } b \\neq 0\\}$\n",
    " - $\\mathbb{R}$ is is the **real numbers** when you think of \"numbers\" these are probably what comes to mind. More on their definition is below. \n",
    " - $\\mathbb{C}$ is the **complex numbers** or **imaginary numbers**. These are the set $\\mathbb{C} := \\{a + bi: a, b \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}$, where $i$ is the imaginary unit: $i := \\sqrt{-1}$\n",
    "  - $\\mathbb{R^n}$ is the set of n-tuples of real numbers: $\\mathbb{R}^n := \\{(x_1, x_2, .... x_n): x_1, x_2 ... x_n \\in \\mathbb{R} \\} $. $\\mathbb{R}^3$ for example is 3d space."
