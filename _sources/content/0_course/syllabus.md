# Syllabus and Overview of PHY 415

In designing this course, I plan to emphasize more independent learning on your part and greater agency for you in determining what you learn and how you demonstrate you have learned. So you should expect:

  * to read a variety of pieces of information to coordinate information
  * to present your ideas publicly and to discuss them
  * to learn new approaches and novel techniques on your own
  * to become more expert than me in the areas of your interest
  * to learn more about scientists that you have not learned about

This is not to say that you are on your own. Here's what you can expect from me:

  * resources, information, and tools to help you learn
  * support and scaffolding to move you towards more independence in your learning
  * timely and detailed feedback to help you along
  * a commitment to an inclusive classroom

## Grading
Details about [course activities are here](design.md) and [information regarding assessment is here](assessments.md). Your grade will be comprised of weekly discussion questions and several projects that you will complete in the form of a Jupyter notebook (a "computational essay", which we will discuss later). Your grade on each project is split between completion (50%) and quality (50%). We will collectively define "quality" in class, but we have provided [a preliminary rubric](rubric.md) for us to work from for the first project. Your final grade will be scaled based on your best performances; there will be slightly more projects than what comprises your grade.  *The intent here is to to allow you space to explore a model or project that you really enjoy, and to reward you for doing that.* How your grade is calculated appears below.

| Activity                                  | Percent of Grade |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------:|
| Best Project Grade                        |        30%       |
| 2nd Best Project Grade                    |        25%       |
| 3rd Best Project Grade                    |        20%       |
| 4th Best Project Grade                    |        10%       |
| Weekly Discussion Questions (completion)  |        15%       |

**While attendance is not required, you are unlikely to succeed with your projects without regular attendance and engagement.**
