# Assessments

## Formative Assessment

Formative assessment is often ungraded and reflective assessment. It is meant to help you make changes to your thinking, approaches, or practice. It is not evaluative, it's corrective; to help you make changes. We will make heavy use of ungraded formative feedback throughout the course. 

## Summative Assessment

Summative assessment is typically evaluative and will take the form of course projects completed out of class. These projects will take the form of a computational essay in which you write mathematics and code to investigate and explain a given phenomenon of interest. We will explore those essays in class and talk about what makes a useful one as we define a rubric for evaluation. 

### Preliminary Rubric

[A preliminary rubric](rubric.md) has been posted. We will use this rubric for the first out-of-class project evaluation. We will then reflect on it and make changes to collectively as a class.
