# Calendar

In this course, we will cover three principal topics in physics (in this order):

- [Oscillations](../2_oscillations/readings-oscillators.ipynb)
- Fields
- Distributions

We will spend roughly 1/3 of the course on each, and the expectaitn is that each topic has 2 completed projects.

A Google Calendar appears below for class. If you review the notes in a given event, you will find the details for a class or the readings to do.
