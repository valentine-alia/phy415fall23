    "A **Frame of Reference**, **Reference Frame**, or simply **Frame** is a set of coordinates. These coordinates describe where things are. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An **inertial frame** is a Frame where newtons first law holds, which means that in this frame a net force of zero means an acceleration of zero. In practice, this means that if you have two frames that are moving at a constant velocity relative to each other (without rotation), these are inertial frames."

You're a physics major so you naturally feel the urge to unnececarily mathematically analyze this situation using reference frames. \n",
